My Preparation Journey for Google Interviews

Preparation TIPS
45 mins daily of Coding/DS&A prep is more than enough to knock it out of the park in Coding rounds.
Leetcode & Geeks for Geeks are highly recommended. Practice mock interviews on PRAMP.COM
Prep videos on Youtube Coding    System Design   Leadership
What are we looking for?
Ability to arrive at the optimal solution with 0 hints in 45 mins
Communication: thinking out loud and walking your interviewer through your code & solution
Dry running & testing your code
Ability to convert DS&A into code
Not over complicating the solution (10 lines of clean code is better than 35 lines of infinite loops) & writing clean, readable & reusable code
L5s generally find it tough with respect to Dynamic Programming, Graphs (DFS/BFS), Trees & Recursion. 


Please also note: candidates should really avoid using bruteforce or pseudocode in any Google interview.

Interview Structure
Duration: 45 mins for coding rounds 
Google Hangouts call (video is highly recommended)
Done on "Virtual Interviewing Platform"
Interviewer: Software Engineer from US
Interview dates: Weekdays
Timings: Evening: 7pm  11pm IST

1. GOOD COMMUNICATION
DO
You are expected to “Talk and Code”
Be very verbal about sharing your thought process with the interviewer
Talk through your entire thought process, explaining your rationale and approach (how and why did you derive a particular solution)
Explain your code to the interviewer
Keep the interviewer on track with your entire thought process




DO NOT
Do not keep silent when thinking to yourself. Interviewers find it hard to assess a candidate when they do not know what the candidate is thinking about! 
Do not mumble in an interview

2. ATTITUDE
Independent, proactive attitude suggesting your problem solving skills to the interviewer
Drive/Lead the technical discussion forward
Solve the question with close to zero hints/guidance
Decision making skill set
Are you able to independently derive the solution instead of checking with the interviewer for advice?
Listen carefully to the interviewer 
Receptive to the hints by the interviewer
Integrate hints/suggestions by the interviewer in your solution

3. ALWAYS START BY CLARIFYING THE QUESTION
Ask 34 clarifying questions at the start to reduce the scope of the problem (Scoping)
Do not jump in to solve the question before clarifying the requirements!
Describe a good algorithm to sort 1 million numbers
What is the range of numbers?
How are the numbers distributed
Are these numbers floating integers or positive numbers?
How much memory is there?
Are there duplicates in the numbers?
4. STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS CLEARLY
Given two different sequence of numbers (2 lists), 
Combine them and return them in sorted order.
One approach
Append 2nd to another and sort it.
Complexity of this will be O((m+n)log(m+n))
Let’s do a Better Approach!
Ask your interviewer if the lists are sorted, if so, apply merge operation of merge sort.
Complexity will now be O(m + n), if the sequence is sorted. If not, anyways you have the above solution. 
With this we have ensured there are no loose ends.

NEXT STEPS
Practice, Practice & Practice! Time yourself when practicing & do mock interviews.
How do I know I am ready for the interview?
You know you are ready when you can consistently solve a question in 20 minutes, come up with the most optimized solution with the suggested framework, and be able to do well in all 5 assessment criterias!
Action Step
Send me your preferred interview time slots
Be confident and enjoy the preparation process. ALL THE BEST !!

Technical Tips:
 
Algorithm Complexity: You need to know BigO, time and space complexity. Identify edge cases independently, and distinguish between average case/worst case runtime. The goal is to reach the most optimized solution at the end.
 
Algorithm Complexity: You need to know BigO, time and space complexity. Identify edge cases independently, and distinguish between average case/worst case runtime. The goal is to reach the most optimized solution at the end of the interview, and to have a complete working solution.
 
Coding: We look for clean, bugfree and concise solutions, and wellstructured code with good use of variable and method names. You  should know the coding language, constructs and library functions well and make good use of it’s features. Note that coding speed is very important, and the code should be production ready. Optimize, check for boundary conditions and debug as much as possible.  
 
Sorting: Know how to sort. Don't do bubblesort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say,quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.  

Hash tables: You should know this data structure and how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in the space of one interview.
 
Trees: Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, nary trees, and trietrees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced
binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree,and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
 
Graphs: Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadthfirst search and depthfirst search. Know their computational complexity, their trade offs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*.  

Other data structures: You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NPcomplete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NPcomplete means.  
 
Mathematics: Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because we are surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with nchoosek problems and their ilk the more the better.   Google interviews focus very heavily on algorithms and data structures.

Operating Systems: Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work.Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a process needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multicore, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
 
Important Areas of Assessment:
 
1.Coding  Good code quality (No IDE. Fully functional code. Take care of syntax, good language constructs, clean and concise code) & coding fast(you can code in Codechef timed challenges to practice coding under time pressure)   
2.Good communication  Talk out loud, explain your thought process to the interviewer 
3.Attitude  Being independent, lead/drive the discussion forward while being receptive to hints from interviewers and integrating it in your solution
4.Speed of solving the question (Ideally 20 mins per question)
 
Strategy for Success (Framework):
 
Step 1: Clarify the problem  

Step 2: Define your approach  

Step 3: Propose a solution before coding > feel free to say that your first solution will be refined later >  Run through at least one or two examples to check for correctness > Use reasonable variable names or clean up the code after the first pass > Ask if the interviewer has any questions before refinement.    

Step 4: Propose an alternative solution.  

Step 5: Implementation.
 
Interview Preparation Plan (created by Google Software Engineers):
 
1. Revise all concepts on data structures & algorithms you can also use this gitHub link <https://github.com/jwasham/googleinterviewuniversity/blob/master/README.md#googleinterviewuniversity> on CS fundamentals that can serve as a checklist while preparing. This Big O cheat sheet <http://bigocheatsheet.com/ <http://bigocheatsheet.com/>>could help you as well!*

2. *Structured Revision plan *on the topics that to cover (Eg.hashtable, hashmaps, trees, arrays, strings, graphs, dynamic programming and more)
 
3.Practise per category: Practice up to a level that you reach competency  Solve the question in 20/40 minutes (for medium and hard problems respectively) and come up with the optimal solutions
*Practice  *Problem Identification* by picking random problems and practicing identifying “Which category does this problem belong to? Backtracking/Dynamic programming? Solution/Algorithmic design?”.

 4. *Practice coding without an IDE*, be familiar with the differences in how you should write code in Google Docs. Do practice coding in Google Docs within a set time frame and getting comfortable talking while coding.

In summary: Practice a wide variety of questions, and simulate actual Interview conditions! You can also run *mock interviews* here at pramp.com
 
Frequently asked topics (in no particular order)
 
Binary search, BFS/DFS/Flood fill, Tree traversals, Hash tables, Linked list, stacks, queues, two pointers/sliding window, Binary heaps, Dynamic programming, Union find, Ad hoc/string manipulations  
Other good to know topics: Trie, segment trees/fenwick trees, bitmask.

 You'll be expected to know and apply: *lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, bags, and sets*.

For algorithms you'll want to know *greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion, and brute force search*.
*You'll definitely want to be conversant with big­ O notation,time­space complexity, and real world performance of all of this.*
 
What we are assessing for Data Structures & Algorithms
Can you implement the most optimized data structure and algorithm for the question?
Can you explain the tradeoffs between the data structure/solution?
Can you explain why you choose a data structure for implementation?
Can you explain and analyze the time and space complexity correctly?
Can you translate the algorithm to code well for the interview, and to have a complete working solution?
